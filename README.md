## Desired Outcome
![desired outcome](./desired-outcome.png)

![font-color](./fonts-color.png)

You can download the design images and use them as a reference for building and styling your landing page.

## Key Features
- Responsive layout using Flexbox (desktop-focused only)
- Hero section (main headline/hero text at the top)
- Four main content sections, plus a footer
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Organized single CSS stylesheet

## How to Approach
### Break it Down:
The landing page is divided into 4 main sections and a footer. Work on one section at a timeâ€”starting from the top is usually most manageable.

### Build the Content First:
Add all necessary content to your HTML for a given section before styling with CSS.

### Style With CSS:
Once content is in place, use CSS (preferably with Flexbox) to layout and style your section.
Return to the HTML only when necessary.

### Refer Back:
If you get stuck, refer back to the Flexbox exercises for help.

### No Need for Mobile Yet:
This project does not require mobile responsiveness. Focus on making it look correct on desktop screens.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn
- Laying out a page using Flexbox
- Translating design mockups into code
- Organizing HTML and CSS in a structured way
- Refining attention to spacing, alignment, color, and consistency

## Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open index.html in your browser to view the landing page.
- You may edit the HTML or CSS files to make improvements or customizations.
